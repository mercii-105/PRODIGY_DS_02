Task-02: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this task, we performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

✅ Data Cleaning:

Checked for missing values in columns like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Filled missing Age values with the median.

Filled missing Embarked values with the most common port.

Dropped the Cabin column due to too many missing values.

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explored survival rates across different passenger classes, genders, and ages.

Created visualizations to understand relationships between features and survival, such as:

Bar charts of survival rate by gender.

Histograms of age distribution.

Bar plots showing survival by passenger class.

Identified patterns like higher survival rates for females and first-class passengers.

This analysis helped reveal key trends and insights in the Titanic dataset.
